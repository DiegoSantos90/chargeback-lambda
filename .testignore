# Test Coverage Exclusions
# Directories and files excluded from test coverage analysis

## Excluded Directories (No Tests Needed)
examples/                    # Example code and demonstrations
docs/                       # Documentation files
scripts/                    # Build and deployment scripts
deployments/                # Infrastructure configuration
docker/                     # Docker configuration files
bin/                        # Compiled binaries
.git/                       # Git repository data

## Excluded File Types
*.md                        # Markdown documentation
*.yml, *.yaml              # Configuration files
*.json                     # Static configuration
Dockerfile*                # Docker files
Makefile                   # Build configuration

## Reasoning for Exclusions

### examples/
- Contains demonstration code for learning purposes
- Not part of production codebase
- Testing would not add business value

### docs/
- Static documentation
- No executable code to test

### scripts/
- Build and deployment utilities
- Often shell scripts or simple automation
- Testing overhead outweighs benefits

### deployments/
- Infrastructure as Code (Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.)
- Configuration files for deployment
- Should be validated by deployment tools

### docker/
- Container configuration
- Validated by Docker build process
